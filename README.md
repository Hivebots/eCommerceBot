# eCommerceBot
Scenario 7

Adventure Works wants to build a bot for eCommerce: Users will use it to search for products and buy them. The bot is expected to work on different channels. They want you to help figuring out how to prototype this bot experience, including: 
 - Searching and selecting products 
 - Building a shopping cart 
 - Paying (using PayPal) 

The company believes they can use the bot and cognitive APIs to make the sopping experience more compelling. For example, can the bot recognize a product from a photo taken from the phone and then show similar ones available for sale? Would be browsing and shopping a compelling enough experience on a bot?
